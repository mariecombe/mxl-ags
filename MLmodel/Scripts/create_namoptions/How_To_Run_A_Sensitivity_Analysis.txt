How to make a sensitivity analysis of the MXL-AGs model

0) Prepare the war zone
-----------------------------------------
- remove all old sensitivity runs 
- check the namoptions file in ~/Modelling/MXL/MLmodel/ is it the correct control case?
- copy the control case namoptions to directory Files_script/create_sensitivity/ and rename it namoptions_


1) create the namoptions files
--------------------------------------------------
-	open a sensitivityvarname file script (eg: 'sensitivitywg') in Users / mariecombe / Modeling / MXL / MLmodel /
-	save it under a new name: eg. sensitivitythetam0 (here because we want to vary the parameter thetam0).
-	Do a 'Replace all' manip: replace the old variable name (ex: 'wg') by the new variable name (in our example: 'thetam0') with the options:
	'Ignore case' OFF ; 
	'Match whole word only' OFF
-	change the range of values you want to apply
	1- define the range you want, divide it by 100, you get the step S you need to apply to get 101 values, 
	eg. for P4: I want to get 101 values between 0. and 15. --> S = 0.15, In python write:
	> import numpy
	> a = numpy.arange(0,15.15,0.15)
	> for i,val in enumerate(a):
	> print 'P4[%d]=%.2f'%(i+1,val)
	and copy paste the result in the file
-	update the total number of values 'amountthetam0' you want to apply
-	change the original value of thetam0 under the first sed command, AND the line number at which the variable is found
-	change the directory name under the second sed command if needed (original directory name? or just 'SENS_' ?)
-	finally: change the Listoffiles variables so that it recognizes the right amount of namoptions_ files ('namoptions_* ? or 'namoptions_var1*' ? depends if you are creating the first round of namoptions files or building on it)
-	Save this 'sensitivityvarname' file
Do everything listed above again for a second variable: eg. cm0.
Run the first file, then the second. 
Check your created namoptions file to see if everything went well.

2) copy all namoptions to ~/Modelling/MXL/MLmodel/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
find.....

2) Run the model for all the namoptions files created
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NB: you can launch tmux -CC now, in case you have a large amount of runs to complete

Open the 'executeRUNS' file in the same folder.
Change the 'Listoffiles' variable so that it recognizes the right combination of variables (eg. in our case: 'namoptions_th*cm*')
Change the 'Outputdir' variable: this is the name of the directory where all the output will be saved.
Save the file
Run this script


3) Extract the interesting data into a single file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the 'analyzeSENS.py' file in the same folder
Update the Var1, Var2 names and their ranges of values
If needed: update the variables being written to the Results file
Save the file
Run the script under the interactive python interface (for debugging)


4) Plot the data
--------------------------
Open the 'plotSENS.py' file in the same folder
Copy Paste the variables names and their ranges of values from 'analyzeSENS.py'
Save the file
Run the script under the interactive python interface (for debugging)
Check your plots. Is it what you expected?

5) The spring cleaning
----------------------------------
If you have successfully completed your runs and your analysis, you can do:
rm -r SENS_*
cp namoptions.saved namoptions
rm -f namoptions_*

OR

just move the SENS_* directories and the namoptions_* files to a new directory like SENS_thetam0_cm0
