How to initialize the MXL model:

-A- Run general settings
how many hours to run (from what time to which time)?
starts at what hour?
lat? lon? day? important: will determine your Qnet if radiation scheme is ON
output directory name?

-B- Fixed surface fluxes
Look in the observations and convert max.SH and max.LE from W/m2 to K.m/s and g/kg.m/s
wthetamax = max.SH * ...
wqsmax = max.LE * ...
Then:
	1- First you need to initialize temperature : play with thetam0, dthetam0 and gamma
	⁃	thetam0: it is in the observations (temperature not close to sfc, at start time of run)
	⁃	dthetam0: influences the start of the theta curve, and the speed at which h rises.
	⁃	gamma: influences the last part of the curve. high gamma == higher increase of thetam after the initial temperature jump has been absorbed. NB: this has a strong impact on development of BL height.
